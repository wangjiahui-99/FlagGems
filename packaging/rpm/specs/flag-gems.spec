# Filter the auto-generated Requires for: torch + numpy/pyyaml/sqlalchemy/packaging.
# Reason: torch: distro version is CPU-only. numpy/pyyaml/sqlalchemy/packaging: distro has them but FlagGems pyproject uses == pins that distro versions do not match; we Require them below without a version constraint instead.
# See packaging/INSTALL.md (or future flagos-packaging install docs) for the
# user-side pip install incantation.
# Two rpm >= 6 (fc43) pitfalls, both verified empirically:
#   1. The regex is matched against the full dependency string including
#      the version part ("python3.14dist(numpy) = 1.26.4"), so the version
#      tail must be covered — a bare ...\)$ silently filters nothing.
#   2. %%global eats single backslashes at definition time ("\(" reaches
#      the regex engine as "("), silently turning literal parens into
#      groups — use [(] bracket classes instead of backslash escapes.

%description
FlagGems is an operator library for large language models implemented in
the Triton language, providing a multi-backend interface for diverse AI
hardware platforms.

This Phase 1 RPM ships the pure-Python distribution (upstream's default
`pip install flag_gems` behavior), including the bundled flaggems_tests
and flaggems_benchmark suites. Phase 2 will package the C++ operators
built from the upstream cpp/ tree (per-vendor flag-gems-cpp-* native
extensions).

%prep
%autosetup -n flag-gems-%{version}

# The C++ operators runtime lives in the separate cpp/ tree (its own
# per-vendor flag-gems-cpp-* wheels upstream); this Phase 1 rpm builds
# the pure-Python wheel only.
%build
# The source tarball carries no .git metadata; pin the scm version.

# Smoke find_spec test — verifies module lands at expected sitelib path.
# Doesn't actually import flag_gems because that triggers torch + triton
# imports, neither of which is in the build container (and shouldn't be:
# those are install-time runtime concerns).
# PYTHONSAFEPATH=1 keeps the cwd (the unpacked source tree, which also
# contains flag_gems/) off sys.path, so find_spec resolves against the
# installed copy under PYTHONPATH (sitearch/sitelib), not the source tree.
