"""Read Pretune shape YAML and write stable run artifacts.

Inputs:
    Shape input is a required PyYAML document whose selected top-level operator
    contains ``shape_spec`` or legacy ``shape_desc`` and a ``shapes`` list.
    Output helpers accept ordered result mappings produced by benchmark workers.

Outputs:
    The module writes ``pretune.csv``, ``pretune.jsonl``, ``manifest.json``, and
    the combined ``pretune.log`` in a timestamped run directory.

Implementation:
    YAML parsing is intentionally operator agnostic: declared field names and
    row values are preserved and handed to the compiled data-driven shape
    schema for semantic validation. JSONL uses grouped Schema v3 objects, while
    CSV writes the equivalent dimensions and metrics as stable flat columns.

Limitations:
    PyYAML is mandatory.  YAML aliases and values are accepted according to
    ``yaml.safe_load`` behavior, but each shape must be a flat sequence with the
    exact declared length.  Artifact writes are not atomic and do not resume a
    partially written run.
