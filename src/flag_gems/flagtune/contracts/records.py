"""Define operator-independent records shared by FlagTune planning stages.

The records in this module are deliberately free of tensor, kernel, and
operator-specific behavior.  The CLI planner creates them from validated shape
tables, selection attaches a variant and stable index, and the benchmark
scheduler serializes them into worker task files.

All shape identity ordering comes from the insertion order of ``values``.  A
caller must therefore construct records through the compiled operator schema or
otherwise preserve the schema's declared identity order.

            the operator YAML schema.

        The dataclass is frozen to prevent stages from silently changing a
