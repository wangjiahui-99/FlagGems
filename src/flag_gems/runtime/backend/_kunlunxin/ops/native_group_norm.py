#   affine  (N * C,      HxW)              -> y = x * scale + shift
#                                                     one row per (batch, channel)
#
# Both rows are contiguous in a contiguous NCHW input, so both fit the
# `[XBLOCK, YBLOCK]` cluster-DMA tile that sum.py's `_tle_sum_row_kernel` uses:
# GM -> LM -> registers, no per-element GM pointer arithmetic. The fused
# GM-pointer kernel below walks the same bytes with `tl.load(X + base + idx)`,
# which is why it measured 0.06x of aten.
#
# TWO passes over the data, not one, and the reason is a hardware gap rather than
# taste. The hand-written XDNN kernel does group norm in ONE kernel
# (api/src/kernel/kunlun3cpp/kunlun3cpp_aten/group_norm_fwd.xpu): it gives each
# cluster a slice of the N * group groups, splits one group's `n` elements across
# SEVERAL CORES, and reduces across those cores through shared memory and a
# cluster barrier -- `sum_sm[transposed_cid] = sum; mfence_sm(); sync_all();
# groupsum_sm(...)`, lines 968-973 -- after which every core has the group's mean
# and can apply the affine in the same kernel.
#
# tle.gpu has the shared-memory scope and the SM fence but NOT that barrier: the
# XPU op set is copy / normcopy / raw / dma_wait, and there is no `core_id()`
# either, because `tritonxpu-tle-core-tiling` is what assigns tile ROWS to cores.
# So a single tle kernel has to keep a whole group in one program, and that
# program's tile is only `group_size` rows -- 2 on the benchmark shapes, leaving
# 62 of 64 cores idle. That is exactly the corner the fused GM-pointer kernel
# below is in, and why it measured 0.06x of aten.
#
# Splitting at the barrier instead lets each pass pick the tile it wants.

    """Whole group norm for one tile of group-rows, the tle_layernorm way.

    A program owns XBLOCK contiguous groups. With XBLOCK >= 2 the rows
    core-tile whole and the reduce is core-local (no barrier); with XBLOCK == 1
    the [1, WT] tile is LargeN -- the row splits across ALL 64 cores and the
    reduce goes cross-core through the standard smem+barrier path, which is what
    lets the widest rows (group_size * HxW = 32768) fuse at all. mean/rstd are
    computed and the row is normalized, one kernel, one launch.

    WIDE rows (WT >= the loop threshold) hold too many per-core columns to sit
    in registers at once ("kernel stack over budget / vrf escalation"), so they
    take a TWO-PASS SEGMENT LOOP inside the same kernel: reduce segment by
    segment, then normalize segment by segment, over one [XBLOCK, RB] tile. The
    input is read from GM twice, but the launch count stays ONE and XBLOCK stays
    free to grow -- which is what keeps the program count down (a per-row
    program grid on a wide shape queues 16 waves on 8 clusters).

    The per-channel weight/bias is the one thing layernorm does not have: within
    a group-row, column j belongs to channel `group*group_size + j // HxW`, and
    the group differs per row. Weight/bias are staged into cluster SHARED memory
    (smem, not per-core lmem) and indexed by that computed channel map with
    `local_ptr`. The scope matters: an LM `local_ptr` DROPS its index and hands
    back the core's own contiguous slice (that is how the `a` tile is
    addressed), so an LM weight buffer would ignore `ch` and multiply by the
    wrong lane -- measured as y off by 4.8 while mean/rstd stayed exact. Only
    the SM `local_ptr` honours an arbitrary index. Either way it stays off the
    GM-gather path that hangs the cluster.
