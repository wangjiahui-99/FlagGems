# Scheduled and On-Demand Testing

Beyond per-PR checks, FlagGems runs broader test sweeps on a schedule to
catch regressions that only show up across the full operator suite or across
vendors that aren't touched by a given PR.

## `daily.yaml` — full-suite regression on NVIDIA

**Trigger:** cron `3 16 * * *` (00:03 Beijing time, daily); also manual
`workflow_dispatch`.

Runs the entire operator test suite (not just changed operators) on the
NVIDIA runner:

- `cpp-op` — the full C++ extension test suite.
- `python-op` — `tools/test-op.sh` with `CHANGED_FILES=__ALL__`, which
  expands to every `tests/test*.py` file. Also collects coverage and
  uploads it as the `op-ut-coverage` artifact.
- `examples` — `tools/test-examples.sh` against all example/model tests.

## `coverage.yaml` — publish coverage to the docs site

**Trigger:** `workflow_run` after `daily` completes; also manual
`workflow_dispatch` with a `run_id` input.

Downloads the `op-ut-coverage` artifact produced by `daily.yaml`, unpacks
the HTML coverage report and summary markdown, commits them under
`docs/static/coverage/<date>` and `docs/content/en/references/test/unit/`,
and pushes directly to the `gh-pages` branch. `hugo-site.yaml` then rebuilds
and republishes the site in response to that push.

## `ops-test.yaml` — multi-vendor QA acceptance testing

**Trigger:** `workflow_dispatch` only, with optional `branch`, `vendors`,
`ops`, `upload_log`, and `send_feishu` inputs. GitHub Actions' native
`schedule` trigger isn't used — it was observed to delay or drop runs by
1-5 hours under load, which isn't acceptable for GPU test scheduling.
Instead, `.github/scripts/trigger_workflow.sh` is installed as a crontab job
on an always-on control-plane server; by default it fires `30 21 * * 3,6`
(Beijing time, Wednesday and Saturday) and calls the GitHub API to dispatch
this workflow, so GitHub still allocates the runners and executes it. The
script retries on failure and checks for a duplicate run before retrying, to
avoid double-triggering.

Runs the full (or a filtered) operator suite across every enabled vendor
backend for QA acceptance testing — of a scheduled sweep via the external
dispatcher, or of a specific branch/vendor/operator set via a manual run
before a release. The `prepare` job resolves the checkout ref (defaulting
to `master`) and builds the backend matrix from
`.github/configs/backends/config.yaml` plus one YAML file per backend,
filtered by the `vendors` input (case-insensitive, empty = all enabled
vendors); the `ops` input likewise narrows the run to specific operators
(empty = every stage via `--stages all`).

Backends are split into two execution modes:

- **Container-based** (`test-container`) — runs inside the backend's Docker
  image, for vendors whose SDK is distributed as a container. Job timeout
  is 1440 minutes (24h) to accommodate the longest vendor runs (e.g. Ascend
  910B).
- **Native** (`test-native`) — runs directly on the self-hosted runner
  without a container, with an 1080-minute (18h) job timeout.

Each matrix job retries checkout up to three times (with 30s backoff),
installs FlagGems, checks GPU availability, runs `tools/run_tests.py`
scoped by `--ops` or `--stages all`, summarizes results with
`add_labels`/`psum_text`/`psum_html`, packages them into a per-vendor
archive, and — unless disabled via the `upload_log`/`send_feishu` inputs —
uploads the archive to the internal op-monitor service and posts a Feishu
notification with the outcome.

## `command.yaml` — on-demand `/test` command

**Trigger:** `issue_comment` created on a PR, matching `/test
<operator>:<runner>`.

Lets any PR participant with the right permissions request an ad-hoc test
of a single operator on a specific runner (e.g. `/test
constant_pad_nd:mthreads`) without waiting for the operator to have a
`vendor/*` label or for a full CI run. For operators that already have
history, it runs the test before and after the PR's changes and posts a
comparison; for brand-new operators, it posts a single-run report. Results
(and full logs) are attached as a PR comment and an uploaded artifact.

## Feishu and monitoring integrations

- `ci-report-feishu.yaml` reports every `rule-check` completion to a Feishu
  Bitable for tracking pass/fail trends over time.
- `ops-test.yaml` and `command.yaml`'s failure paths send Feishu chat
  notifications via `.github/scripts/notify_feishu.py`.
- `ops-test.yaml` also uploads results to an internal "op-monitor" HTTP
  service for longer-term dashboards.

These are observability workflows; they do not gate merges.
