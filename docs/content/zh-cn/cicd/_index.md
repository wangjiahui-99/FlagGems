# CI/CD

This section documents the GitHub Actions workflows that make up FlagGems'
continuous integration and delivery pipeline: what runs on a pull request,
what runs on a schedule, and what runs on release.

- [Pull request checks](pull-request/) — workflows triggered by opening,
  updating, or commenting on a pull request
- [Scheduled and on-demand testing](scheduled/) — daily full-suite tests,
  coverage reporting, multi-vendor QA acceptance testing, and on-demand
  `/test` commands
- [Release and sync](release-sync/) — building/publishing wheels and
  mirroring the repository to other remotes
-->
